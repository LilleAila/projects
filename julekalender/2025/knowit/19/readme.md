[F,G] 0 > 1. [D,E] 0 > 2. [C] 0 > 3. [E] 2 > 3. [F,G] 1 > 2. [B] 0 > 1. [A] 0 > 4. [B] 1 > 4. [C,E] 3 > 4. [D,F,G] 2 > 4.

Alternative correct solution but it is invalid???

```
[E,F,G] 0 > 1. [D] 0 > 2. [F,G] 1 > 2. [E] 1 > 0. [C,E] 0 > 1. [B] 0 > 3. [A] 0 > 4. [B] 3 > 4. [C,E] 1 > 4. [D,F,G] 2 > 4.
